           <h1>The graphic card</h1>
           <br>
           <P><b>A video card</b>, video adapter or graphics card is an expansion card whose function is to generate images to a monitor.</P> 
           <p>Many video cards have added features, such as accelerated playback of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, TV tuner adapter, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, or the ability to use multiple monitors (multi-monitor),</p>
           <p> RTX(Re-Tra-cing) or DLSS(Deep Learning Super Sampling).Other modern video cards are used for more "stressful" purposes, such as PC gaming. </p>
           <p>Video cards can be integrated into the processor in some PCs. This graphics chip usually has a small amount of memory and takes up some of the main system's RAM, thus reducing the total RAM available.</p> 
            <p>This is also called integrated graphics which has a low level of performance and is undesirable for those who want to run 3D applications. Almost all motherboards allow you to disable integrated graphics via the BIOS. This requires the motherboard to have AGP, PCI or PCI-Express support for attaching a dedicated video card.</p> 
            <p>The top motherboards allow the addition of multiple video cards, which can be connected via the SLI interface for NVIDIA video cards, and CrossFire for AMD video cards.</P>

              <h3>Historical progress</h3>
              <p>Over the past few decades, the video card has seen several approaches by several companies.</p>
              <p>The first video card was developed by IBM in 1981 and was called MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter) and could only work in text mode represented by 80 columns and 25 lines (80x25)</p>
              <p>It had a memory of only 4KB and had only one colour.</p>

            <h3>Geforce 256</h3>
            <p>Gefroce 256 was the first proper video card launched by Nvidia in 1999.</p>
            <p>For that time, the Geforce 256 was a revolutionary thing, featuring 220nm technology, an NV10 graphics processor and support for DirectX 7.0.</p>

             <p><b>*Note: DirectX</b> is a set of programs responsible for multimedia tasks, such as video and audio playback, made by Microsoft. (current version - DirectX 12)</p>
             <br>
             <h3>GDDR (Graphic Double Data Rate)</h3>
             <p>GDDR is a type of Dual Playback Rate (DDR) video memory specifically designed for use with video cards. GDDR differs from DDR by different frequencies and latencies</p>
             <p>GDDR is accessed by the graphics processing unit and also contains electrical interface simplifications and a high bandwidth, while having lower power consumption.</p>
             <p>The first GDDR memory was introduced in 1998 by Samsung as a 16Mb DDR-SDRAM memory chip.</p>
             <p>Over time, several generations of GDDR have been developed, each generation being faster and more improved: GDDR, GDDR 2, GDDR 4, GDDR 5, GDDR 6 (current version). </p>
